### Introduction

Hey there, ambitious entrepreneur!

Have you already heard of the term Agile?

If you think it refers to how fast you dribble around people to get your first morning coffee‚Ä¶ that is not it!

Agile is a methodology originally created for software project management, but it‚Äôs now widely applied to many other industries. The key elements of this methodology are keeping flexible in an ever-changing environment, fostering collaboration between team members, and focusing on incremental value delivery.

Sounds good, right?

If you have a small or medium-sized team, there are many elements of Agile that you can implement to deliver better results fast!

I‚Äôm here to give you all the information you need to start implementing Agile today for your team. Ready?

Agile is a great fit for small and medium teams:

- Adaptability to change.
- Encourages innovation and collaboration.
- Promotes efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### What is Agile, and Why Does It Matter?

Let‚Äôs face it: traditional project management is not very flexible.

Imagine you are building a bridge. You decide where to build it, set a budget, create a timeline, break down all the tasks, and execute them. TADA! Bridge done.

Well, this is the ideal case. In reality, things go wrong‚Äîsuppliers mess up, timelines shift, you name it.

In traditional project management methods like Waterfall, there are ways to handle change. But imagine being in the middle of pouring the last of the concrete and hearing your client say: ‚ÄúActually, we‚Äôd like the bridge to be over there instead‚Ä¶‚Äù

Now contrast this with modern software and digital projects, which require flexibility and adaptability. Enter Agile!

The philosophy behind Agile is summarized in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/):

- ü§ù **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- üîß **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- üìà **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- ‚ö° **Responding to change** over following a plan

Not to say the things on the right aren‚Äôt important, but the things on the left are **more** important.

The highest priority of Agile is to ‚Äúsatisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.‚Äù It welcomes change, even late in the project.

This mindset allows teams to quickly adapt to market changes, ensure client satisfaction, and deliver high-value products.

You might say: ‚ÄúBut Camilla, it clearly says software, and we don‚Äôt deliver software products! What does this have to do with me?!‚Äù

While Agile was initially created for software development, it‚Äôs now widely used across many different sectors with similar needs: rapidly changing environments, customer deliverables, and skilled teams.

### Agile Frameworks and Their Suitability for Small Teams

Agile isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all solution. There are several frameworks to choose from, depending on your team‚Äôs needs. Choosing the right Agile framework depends on your team‚Äôs dynamics, goals, and challenges. Here‚Äôs a high-level guide to help you decide:

- **Scrum:**
    - Best for teams that prefer structure and clear roles (e.g., Scrum Master, Product Owner, Team Members).
    - Ideal for projects requiring iterative progress with defined sprints and deliverables.
    - ‚û°Ô∏è Opt for Scrum if your team thrives on routine, such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.
- **Kanban:**
    - Great for teams needing flexibility and continuous workflow improvement.
    - Best for visualizing tasks, identifying bottlenecks, and balancing work in progress.
    - ‚û°Ô∏è Choose Kanban if your team handles tasks with varying priorities and deadlines.
- **Lean:**
    - Focused on reducing waste and delivering maximum value efficiently.
    - Suitable for resource-conscious teams looking to streamline processes and eliminate inefficiencies.
    - ‚û°Ô∏è Consider Lean if your goal is to optimize workflow and enhance productivity with minimal overhead.
- **Hybrid Approaches:**
    - Combines the structure of Scrum with the flexibility of Kanban.
    - Useful for teams that need a mix of sprint-based planning and dynamic task management.
    - ‚û°Ô∏è Go hybrid if your team values both adaptability and some level of predictability.

To choose the right framework, assess your team‚Äôs size, strengths, and the complexity of your projects. Consider running a short pilot with one framework and adapt as you learn what works best for your team.

I will be writing a detailed article soon about each of these frameworks, so stay tuned!
